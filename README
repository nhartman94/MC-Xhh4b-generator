Right now the script Xhh4b.py has an optional input the mass of the graviton mass and the number of iterations 
of X->hh->4b graviton simulations for the given masspoint

To input a graviton mass of 800 GeV with 1000 iterations, type into the command line

python --mX 800 --N 1000

If an  argument is not specified, the default graviton mass is 500 GeV and the default number of iterations is 100.

Currently, the graviton is assumed to be a scalar that starts at rest, although I'll be modifying this over the 
next week.

When you increase the graviton's mass, you can see the b-quarks from the individual Higgses become collimated.
For example, compare the deltaR b-quark distributions for mX = 300 and mX = 2000 (GeV), and you can see why using
a large-R jet gives better analysis results than two resolved anti-kT jets with R = 0.4.


The next file is XXhh4b_invXformSampling_scalarGraviton.py takes the same input, but it calculates the output using the more efficient
method of inverse transform sampling.  This is just to test that I get the same results when I use inverse transform sampling as with
the old method.
(I'll probably delete this file eventually.)

Finally: uses XXhh4b_invXformSampling.py using inverse sampling to decay the spin 2 graviton and the scalar Higgs bosons.
