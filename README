Right now the script Xhh4b_invXformSampling.py has an optional input the mass of the graviton mass, the number of iterations, 
and the momentum of the the graviton in the x direction 
of X->hh->4b graviton simulations for the given masspoint

To input a graviton mass of 800 GeV with 1000 iterations and a momentum 100 GeV, type into the command line

python --mX 800 --N 1000 --pX 100

If an  argument is not specified, the default graviton mass is 500 GeV and the default number of iterations is 100,
while X is assumed to decay at rest..
